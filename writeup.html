          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text indent">My initial goal for this project was to build a working Pomodoro timer app that I could
               use on my phone while I am at work, because I find them very helpful. And for that core intention, I 
               succeeded. I knew that building a “front end only” app would require me to dust off and expand my 
               understanding and use of JavaScript, and of course I was correct.</p>

            <p class="card-text indent">I intended to build a customizable app that seamlessly transitioned between viewports. For me, the perfect
               Pomodoro timer allows the user to choose a background image, a soundscape, a timer interval, and an alert 
               tone – and I know I can build it. But the scope, detail, and complexity of v1 of this app definitely 
               changed as I began running out of time and energy. The JavaScript for all that functionality was quickly 
               getting quite complex and will require a good bit of time and attention to detail.</p>

            <p class="card-text indent">I still want a fully customizable app and right now I have a responsive app 
              that simply allows the user a choice between three preset Pomodoro’s. I’m the only user right now, and I 
              am comfortable with the responsiveness and the choices I've made available to my only user.
                The functionalities I was aiming for are quite doable.  They will just have to be realized in version 2.0, when I 
                have had a break and am ready to tackle the JavaScript. </p>

            <p class="card-text indent">I planned to use HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, JavaScript, Prism.js, any necessary media-related plugins, 
              GitHub Codespaces, and Netlify. Prism.js proved unnecessary, as it was much easier to just share my 
              GitHub repository than to embed a code window in a page on the app. I did include this writeup here on 
              its own page, but that was simple. Thankfully, no media plugins were necessary; the images just required
                some resizing and one of the soundscape files had to be converted from .wav to .mp3 simply because 
                .wav files are so much larger, and GitHub was having a very hard time syncing with that file onboard. 
                Other than that, the work was mostly wrangling the styling and picking through the JavaScript to get 
                the details correct. </p>

              <p class="card-text indent">As for “other people’s code,” I began with a Bootstrap template and customized it a good bit to fit 
                my vision. I found background images on Unsplash.com, soundscapes on Freesound.com, and got a great 
                deal of JavaScript assistance from Copilot (inside GitHub, which was nice.) </p>

              <p class="card-text indent">My conclusion is: this is a good app. I found great images and soundscapes, 
                I got the code working, and it works on my phone. I’m happy with it.</p>
